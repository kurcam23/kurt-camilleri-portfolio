        "description": "In my role on the CFOUR Comply project, I was a key member of the backend development team, responsible for building a robust and event-driven system using C#. I designed and implemented the core backend structure, creating components that supported the application's key functionalities. A central part of my work involved developing an event-driven system that triggered critical XBRL functions in the backend. I specialized in the XBRL functionalities that processed financial data and produced the final, compliant output. My work ensured the accuracy and integrity of the data, which was crucial for the final product. Additionally, I managed and built various Azure components, including Azure Functions and App Services, to support the application's scalability and deployment. This involved ensuring the cloud infrastructure was stable, efficient, and seamlessly integrated with our C# backend.",
